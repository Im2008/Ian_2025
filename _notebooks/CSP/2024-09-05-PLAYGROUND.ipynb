For example, if I put chicken sandwich, the description aboout a chicken sandwich and where it originated from would be displayed. This would be really helpful especially since if I'm trying to make a webpage about information of other stuff, I wouldn't want to take a lot of time typing information into code, but rather make stuff easier by searching it through the web. I like the wikipedia one more as the library one, which I didn't add, was too url based."
