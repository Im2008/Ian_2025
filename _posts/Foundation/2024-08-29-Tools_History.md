    <p>During my Tools setup, I had trouble trying to figure out why bundle install didn't work. Most of the versions worked well when I ran them, except for bundle, from which it kept saying "bundle isn't a command" on the terminal. To fix this, I ran ./activate.sh again on the terminal, and it allowed bundle to be shown as a command now. Because of this, I was able to get bundle install to work.</p>
