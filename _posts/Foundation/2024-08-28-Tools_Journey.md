    <p>During my Tools Setup, it took a while to figure out the make file, especially since in the terminal, the bundle file wasn't showing. To fix this, I typed in "sudo update apt" to update the ruby version so it'll show bundle later on. Although this didn't work well, it allowed me to update ruby features by doing "gem install bundler" to show how many gems have been updated from it. This allowed bundle to open up, and I was able to do bundle install without anything crashing or stop working. Later on, I was able to do a make file to be able to make a server which allowed student_2025 to show. However, since student_2025 wasn't showing on github, when I tried to open it on my server, the text that I had on vscode vs the server was different. To fix this, I forked the student_2025 repository on github, & renamed it to be Ian_2025 to be more organized. Later I cloned it onto vscode, and was able to get it working.</p>
